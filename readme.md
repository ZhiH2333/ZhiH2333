# Hi, I'm Zhi 👋

I'm currently learning **Flutter** and **Dart**, focusing on building real projects step by step.

## 🚀 Current Project

### Nebula
A feed-based Flutter application built progressively with clean architecture.

**Tech stack:**
- Flutter / Dart
- Riverpod (state management)
- Firebase (Auth & Firestore)
- Material UI

**Current progress:**
- Phase 1: Project structure & authentication foundation
- Phase 1.5: Feed UI skeleton with mock data
- Phase 2: Riverpod integration
- Phase 3: Async provider refactoring
- Phase 4: Firestore feed read integration
- Phase 4.1: Firebase binding (in progress)

The goal is to focus on **architecture clarity**, **state management**, and **incremental development**, rather than rushing features.

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- Flutter app architecture
- Async data flow & state management
- Firebase integration
- Writing maintainable UI code

## 🛠 Tools

- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- Firebase Console

## 📌 Notes

This profile and my repositories reflect my learning process.  
I value **clear structure, small steps, and stability over speed**.
